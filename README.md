# Obsidian Callout Suggestions

This is a user experience enhancing plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

I can never remember all the callout tags. Plus, I've made a few of my own that I use pretty frequently.

This plugin provides a Suggestion Modal for Callouts similar to what you'll find in [Obsidian Natural Language Dates](https://github.com/argenos/nldates-obsidian).
It is compatible with (and depends on) the excellent [Obsidian Callout Manager](https://github.com/eth-p/obsidian-callout-manager).

## Features

## Usage
Trigger the auto-complete with ``` >! ```
